Recursion is the process by which a function calls itself.
The base case is when no recursion is needed, that is, 
the output for a given input is known.
The recursive calls should alter the output as to gradually approach
the input of the base case.
Each time a recursive call is made, the system pushes another 
stack frame in the call stack.
Once we reach the base case, we can return the result, thus popping
the stack frame from the stack.
We will apply the result to the pending operation, 
and continue the process until we get to the top of the stack
