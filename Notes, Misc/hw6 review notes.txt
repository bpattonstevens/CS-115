Compressed block size means the amount of numbers in each section (takes the numbers and separates them by groups of 5).
Inputted 64 zeros, and got the numerical form of how many zeros were inputted.
Next fct counted the values of the ones and zeros to give the numerical value in list form.
Takes amount of similar strings and groups their value together in a length 5 block of 0's and 1's
Always divisible into chunks of whatever the compressed block size is.
Uncompress takes the compressed version of the original input, separates into groups of 5, derives a number from the binary form and returns the decompressed string based on those numbers.
